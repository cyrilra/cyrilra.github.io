### That Wasn't There Before?
For Spring 2025, I chose to take ICS 414 course as an ICS elective and it was a fun and intersting experience. ICS 414 had the class working with a client to build a website for them. However, the class was split into 5 different groups that will all share the same client, but will begin their own website for them. The group I was assigned with were a mix of students who took 314 in the previous spring 2024 semester and those who took the class in Fall 2024 and this lead to a trivial issue though a bit problematic once we figured out what to code with. For context, I took the ICS 314 course in the previous spring semester and that was unfortunately the last time they chose to teach MongoDB, Meteor, and React. One more to add, the newer 314 classes started teaching TypeScript and some of React still (thankfully) and a different backend language though I can't recall which one. 
As such, we weren't so sure as to what languages we should code the website with as one-half of the group would end up having to learn the language we choose regardless. IDEs was easily decided, but the languages were the problem. In the end we chose to do TypeScript with React and used relating frameworks such as TailwindCSS and a different backend that wouldn't need us to deploy in an online hosting service thanks to the 314 template.
